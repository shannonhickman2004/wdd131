                <div class="about-me">


                    <p>Hello! My name is Shannon Hickman. My major is Software Development. My picture is my husband and
                        I, my inspiration for choosing my degree. He has been a programmer for over 30 years, and I hope
                        to help with his start-up company. I have 7 daughters and 4 grandkids. My 4 youngest girls were
                        an unexpected blessing, first belonging to my brother. They came to me from Cambodia and are
                        precious to us. It's been an adventure to parent for 32 years, and my home is filled with family
                        that I love! My oldest is 32, and my youngest is 8, followed by my oldest granddaughter, who is
                        7, followed by 3 more littles. It's like a three-ring circus when they are all home, and I love
                        every minute! My hobbies and interests include time with my family. I love to camp, watch fall
                        football games, do lots of cooking and baking, and in my few quiet moments, I love to read.</p>
